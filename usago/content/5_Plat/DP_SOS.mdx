**Sum Over Subsets (SOS)** is a technique used to efficiently calculate the sum of values for all subsets of a given set or bitmask.

## Implementation

Consider an array $A$ with $2^n$ elements. Our goal is to calculate $F(x)$ for all $x = 0, 1, 2, \dots, 2^n - 1$. Here, $F(x)$ represents the sum of values in array $A$ for all subsets $i$ of $x$. That is:

$$
F(x) = \sum_{i \subseteq x} A[i]
$$

For example, $F(5)=A[0]+A[1]+A[4]+A[5]$.

## Solution

### Brute Force

The naive solution would be to iterate over all pair of masks, summing $A[i]$ only when one of them is a subset of the other $(i.e.,i$ $\&$ $x = i)$.

<LanguageSection>
<CPPSection>

```cpp
vector<int> sos(1 << n);

for (int x = 0; x < (1 << n); x++) {
	// iterate over all other sets and checks whether they're a subset of x
	for (int i = 0; i < (1 << n); i++) {
		if ((i & x) == i) { sos[x] += a[i]; }
	}
}
```

</CPPSection>
<PySection>

```py
sos = [0] * (1 << n)
for x in range(1 << n):
	# iterate over all other sets and checks whether they're a subset of x
	for i in range(1 << n):
		if (x & i) == i:
			sos[x] += a[i]
```

</PySection>
</LanguageSection>

This solution has a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(2^n \cdot 2^n) = O(4^n)$, which is too slow for large values of $n$.

### Optimized Solution: Iterating Over Submasks

Instead of iterating over all $2^n$ bitmasks for $i$, we can optimize by iterating only over the subset mask of $x$ using the formula $i = (i - 1)\& x$, which efficiently generates all valid subsets of $x$ in reverse order. This approach skips unnecessary combinations, significantly reducing the number of iterations and improving the time complexity.

<LanguageSection>
<CPPSection>

```cpp
vector<int> sos(1 << n);

for (int x = 0; x < (1 << n); x++) {
	sos[x] = a[0];
	// iterate over all subsets of x directly
	for (int i = x; i > 0; i = (i - 1) & x) { sos[x] += a[i]; }
}
```

</CPPSection>
<PySection>

```py
sos = [0] * (1 << n)
for x in range(1 << n):
	sos[x] = a[0]
	i = x
	# iterate over all subsets of x directly
	while i > 0:
		sos[x] += a[i]
		i = (i - 1) & x
```

</PySection>
</LanguageSection>

<Spoiler title="How does this work?">

When we subtract $1$ from a bitmask $i$, the rightmost $1$-bit becomes $0$, and all bits to the right of it will become $1$. By performing a bitwise _AND_ with $x$, we ensure that only the bits within $x$ are retained. By starting with $i = x$ and repeatedly applying $(i - 1)$ $\&$ $x$, all subset masks of $x$ are visited in reverse order.

The operation $(i - 1)$ $\&$ $x$ ensures that each new value of $i$ is strictly smaller than the previous one and is also a valid submask of $x$. There is no need to explicitly check $(i$ $\&$ $x) = i$.

</Spoiler>

**Time Complexity:** $ \mathcal{O}(3^n)$

<Spoiler title="Proof">

The number of subset masks for a bitmask of size $k$(i.e., $k$ set bits) is $2^k$. There are $n \choose k$ bitmasks with $k$ set bits. Thus, the total number of operations is:

$$
\sum^n_{k = 0}{n \choose k} \cdot 2^k = (1 + 2)^n = 3^n.
$$

</Spoiler>

### Faster Solution using Dynamic Programming

While the previous method is better, it still has some redundancy. For example, if a bitmask $i$ has $k$ unset bits, then $A[i]$ is summed $2^k$ times. If we precompute and reuse these sums, we can eliminate repeated additions.

#### Subset Mask Partitioning with $S(x, i)$

We define the subset $S(x, i)$ as follows:

$$
S(x, i) = \{y \subseteq x \mid y \oplus x < 2^i\}
$$

In simpler terms, $S(x, i)$ contains all subset masks of $x$ whose bits to the left of the $i$-th bit match those of $x$.

For example:
$$
S(11010110, 3) = \{11010000,11010010,11010100,11010110\}
$$

We can decompose $S(x, i)$ as follows:

1.  If the $i$-th bit of $x$ is $0$, then $S(x, i) = S(x, i - 1)$.
2.  If the $i$-th bit of $x$ is $1$:
    - Subsets with the $i$-th bit $1: S(x, i - 1)$.
    - Subsets with the $i$-th bit $0 : S(x \oplus 2^i, i - 1)$.
Thus:
$$
S(x, i) =
\begin{cases}
S(x, i - 1) & \text{if the i-th bit is 0} \\
S(x, i - 1) \cup S(x \oplus 2^i, i - 1) & \text{if the i-th bit is 1}
\end{cases}
$$

Using the above partitioning, we define a DP table $dp[x][i]$ where:
$$
dp[x][i] = \sum_{y \in S(x, i)} A[y]
$$

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N \cdot 2^N)$

<LanguageSection>
<CPPSection>

```cpp
vector<int> sos(1 << n);
vector<vector<int>> dp(1 << n, vector<int>(n + 1));

for (int x = 0; x < (1 << n); x++) {
	dp[x][0] = a[x];
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		dp[x][i + 1] = dp[x][i];
		if (x & (1 << i)) { dp[x][i + 1] += dp[x ^ (1 << i)][i]; }
	}
	sos[x] = dp[x][n];
}
```

</CPPSection>
<PySection>

```py
sos = [0] * (1 << n)
dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(1 << n)]

for x in range(1 << n):
	dp[x][0] = a[x]
	for i in range(n):
		dp[x][i + 1] = dp[x][i]
		if x & (1 << i):
			dp[x][i + 1] += dp[x ^ (1 << i)][i]

	sos[x] = dp[x][n]
```

</PySection>
</LanguageSection>

#### Optimized Memory Usage

Since $dp[x][i]$ only depends on $dp[x][i - 1]$, we can reuse the DP array.

<LanguageSection>
<CPPSection>

```cpp
sos = a;

for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
	for (int x = 0; x < (1 << n); x++) {
		if (x & (1 << i)) { sos[x] += sos[x ^ (1 << i)]; }
	}
}
```

</CPPSection>
<PySection>

```py
sos = a[:]

for i in range(n):
	for x in range(1 << n):
		if x & (1 << i):
			sos[x] += sos[x ^ (1 << i)]
```

</PySection>
</LanguageSection>

### SOS DP as N-Dimensional Prefix Sum

Before we move on, let's revisit 2D prefix sums. Given $n \times m$ array $A$, the prefix sum array $S$ is defined as:

$$
S[i][j] = \sum_{a \leq i} \sum_{b \leq j} A[a][b]
$$

The standard approach uses inclusion-exlcusion:

$$
S[i][j] = S[i][j - 1] + S[i - 1][j] - S[i - 1][j - 1] + A[i][j]
$$

While this approach works for 2D grids, it has a significant limitation: as the number of dimensions increases, the number of terms we need to add or subtract also increases exponentially, making it inefficient for higher-dimensional grids.

A simple and more scalable approach would be to sweep through each dimensions one at a time and compute the prefix sum step by step:

<LanguageSection>
<CPPSection>

```cpp
// Initialize
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
	for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) { S[i][j] = A[i][j]; }
}

// Sweep along x-axis
for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
	for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) { S[i][j] += S[i - 1][j]; }
}

// Sweep along y-axis
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
	for (int j = 1; j < m; j++) { S[i][j] += S[i][j - 1]; }
}
```

</CPPSection>
<PySection>

```py
# Initialize
for i in range(n):
	for j in range(m):
		S[i][j] = A[i][j]

# Sweep along the x-axis
for i in range(1, n):
	for j in range(m):
		S[i][j] += S[i - 1][j]

# Sweep along the y-axis
for i in range(n):
	for j in range(1, m):
		S[i][j] += S[i][j - 1]
```

</PySection>
</LanguageSection>

This approach generalizes to higher dimensions.

Let's say we want to calculate the prefix sum array for 4D grid. We can calculate this by sweeping along each axis of a 4D grid, one at a time:

- After sweeping along the x-axis, $S[i][j][k][l]$ contains the sum of $A[a][b][c][d]$ where:
	- $a \leq i$
	- $b = j, c = k,$ and $d = l$.
- After sweeping along the y-axis, $S[i][j][k][l]$ contains the sum of $A[a][b][c][d]$ where:
	- $a \leq i, b \leq j$
	- $c = k,$ and $d = l$.
- After sweeping along the z-axis, $S[i][j][k][l]$ contains the sum of $A[a][b][c][d]$ where:
	- $a \leq i, b \leq j, c \leq k$
	- $d = l$.
- Finally, after sweeping along the w-axis, $S[i][j][k][l]$ contains the sum of $A[a][b][c][d]$ where:
	- $a \leq i, b \leq j, c \leq k,$ and $d \leq l$.

If we extend this idea to $n$ dimensions, here's what happens: after sweeping along the $i$-th axis, $S[x]$ contains the sum of the values in $A$ where the first $i$ coordinates are less than or equal to the $x$, and the remaining coordinates match $x$. Sound familiar? That's exactly what $F(x)$ represents in the SOS problem!

If we think of each bit in a bitmask as its own axis, then a bitmask $x$ with $n$ bits can be viewed as an $n$-dimensional coordinate, where each component is either $0$ or $1$. A submask of $x$ corresponds to an $n$-dimensional coordinate where each component is less than or equal to $x$.

Therefore, when we interpret the bitmask as an $n$-dimensional coordinate, $F(x)$ aligns with the definition of an $n$-dimensional prefix sum!

By applying the sweeping algorithm along each axis, we get the memory-optimized SOS DP solution mentioned earlier, demonstrating that SOS DP is indeed an **n-dimensional prefix sum**.

```cpp
F = A;

for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {  // Sweep along the i-th axis
	for (int x = 0; x < (1 << n); x++) {
		if (x & (1 << i))  // If the i-th bit is set, accumulate
			F[x] += F[x ^ (1 << i)];
	}
}
```

</CPPSection>
<PySection>

```py
F = A[:]

for i in range(n):  # Sweep along the i-th axis
	for x in range(1 << n):
		if x & (1 << i):  # If the i-th bit is set, accumulate
			F[x] += F[x ^ (1 << i)]
```

## Explanation

First, think of each word as a combination of letters represented by a bitmask. For example, `bcd` = `0b1110`, and `ada` = `0b1001`, where each bit stands for a letter. We'll also keep track of how often each bitmask appears in the dictionary.

Next, we use SOS DP to compute the number of words disjoint from the mask (i.e., words containing **none of the vowels** in mask). This means the word's bitmask must be a subset of the complement of mask (~mask).

Once this is calculated, the number of valid words for a subset is simply $n - sos[\sim mask]$ because a word is valid if it contains **at least one vowel** from the subset, meaning it is not disjoint from mask. Finally, we square the count of valid words for every subset, XOR all those squared values together, and that gives us the answer.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(M \cdot 2^M)$

<LanguageSection>
<CPPSection>

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

const int M = 24;
int sos[1 << M];

int main() {
	int n;
	std::cin >> n;
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		std::string st;
		std::cin >> st;
		int mask = (1 << (st[0] - 'a')) | (1 << (st[1] - 'a')) | (1 << (st[2] - 'a'));
		sos[mask] += 1;
	}

	for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
		for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << M); mask++) {
			if (mask & (1 << i)) { sos[mask] += sos[mask ^ (1 << i)]; }
		}
	}

	int res = 0;
	for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << M); mask++) {
		// sos[mask] now contains the number of words whose bitmasks are subsets of mask
		int valid_words = n - sos[(1 << M) - 1 - mask];
		res ^= valid_words * valid_words;
	}
	std::cout << res << '\n';
}
```

</CPPSection>
<PySection>

```py
M = 24
sos = [0] * (1 << M)

n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
	st = input()
	mask = (
		(1 << (ord(st[0]) - 97)) | (1 << (ord(st[1]) - 97)) | (1 << (ord(st[2]) - 97))
	)
	sos[mask] += 1


for i in range(M):
	for mask in range(1 << M):
		if mask & (1 << i):
			sos[mask] += sos[mask ^ (1 << i)]

res = 0
for mask in range(1 << M):
	# sos[mask] now contains the number of words whose bitmasks are subsets of mask
	valid_words = n - sos[(1 << M) - 1 - mask]
	res ^= valid_words * valid_words

print(res)
```
