## Explanation

To transform $a$ into $b$, we proceed greedily. If $a > b$, it can be shown that
it is never optimal to add more than once consecutively before dividing $a$ by
2. To see this, consider adding two times before the division. While this leads
to three operations in sum, we can instead first divide and then just add one,
which has the same effect but requires only two operations.

Then, if $a < b$, as the optimality of the strategy above is already shown,
let's reuse it and work on $b$ by allowing multiplication, division, and
subtraction by one. We therefore either divide $b$ by two (and first subtract by
one if $b$ is odd) or subtract $b$ $b - a$ times to directly reach $a$. One can
see that these operations applied on $b$ are equivalent to what one does on $a$
in reversed order.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N \log{\max(A, B)})$

		/*
		 * Divide a greedily until a <= b, add 1 in case a is odd to enable
		 * division.
		 */
		ll is_odd = a % 2;
		return 1 + is_odd + solve((a + is_odd) / 2, b);
	} else {
		/*
		 * Otherwise, work on b to reach a by division. Alternatively,
		 * if it's better, perform subtraction until a is reached.
		 */
		ll is_odd = b % 2;
		return min(b - a, 1 + is_odd + solve(a, b / 2));
	}
