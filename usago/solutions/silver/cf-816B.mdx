## Explanation

In order to find how many "good" coffee brewing temperatures are in a range $[a, b]$, we start by finding which temperatures are recommended by at least $k$ recipes. Instead of checking each temperature one by one, we use a **difference array** to quickly mark all temperatures covered by each recipe's range. Once we've processed all the ranges, we use a **prefix sum** to count how many recipes recommend each temperature. If a temperature is recommended by at least $k$ recipes, we call it "good". Finally, we convert these "good" temperatures into a running total, allowing us to instantly answer Karen's queries by subtracting two values for any range $[a, b]$.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N + Q)$

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using std::cin;
using std::cout;

constexpr int MAX_TEMP = 200000;

int main() {
	int n, k, q;
	cin >> n >> k >> q;

	/*
	 * +2 is required since we are decrementing r + 1 and max r will be 2e5
	 * thus prevents out-of-bounds errors, and the additional +1 ensures safe
	 * prefix sum computation.
	 */
	std::vector<int> diff_arr(MAX_TEMP + 2);

	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		int l, r;
		cin >> l >> r;
		diff_arr[l]++;
		diff_arr[r + 1]--;
	}

	for (int i = 1; i <= MAX_TEMP; i++) { diff_arr[i] += diff_arr[i - 1]; }

	for (int i = 1; i <= MAX_TEMP; i++) {
		diff_arr[i] = (diff_arr[i] >= k) + diff_arr[i - 1];
	}

	for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
		int a, b;
		cin >> a >> b;
		cout << diff_arr[b] - diff_arr[a - 1] << '\n';
	}
}
