<Spoiler title="Hint">

For a subsegment of length $\leq 2 \cdot \texttt{mex}$, the condition $\texttt{mex} > \texttt{med}$ will be satisfied, since the median can be at most $\texttt{mex}-1$.

## Explanation

[Official Analysis](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/108101)

We will iterate $\texttt{mex}$ from $1$ to $n-1$, finding all valid subsegments of that $\texttt{mex}$ at a time.

Let $l$ and $r$ represent the highest left bound and the lowest right bound, respectively, of a subsegment that satisfies a given $\texttt{mex}$, and $\texttt{pos}$ represent the index of $\texttt{mex}$. If we know $l$, $r$, and $\texttt{pos}$, we can quickly count the subsegments for a given $\texttt{mex}$.

We need to find all subsegments of length $\leq 2 \cdot \texttt{mex}$ that contains $l \ldots r$ and omit $\texttt{pos}$. First, let's solve for $\texttt{pos}>r$. Let's iterate $r$ to $\texttt{pos}-1$, finding all bounds of $l$ that satisfy the constraints for each $r$. This is not a time concern as long as we can find all possible values of $l$ in $\mathcal{O}(1)$, since each time we iterate we are increasing the size of the subsegment by $1$.

Considering this new bound of $r$, we can find the number of possible values of $l$ that form a valid subsegment by finding the number of positions $\leq l$ such that $r-l+1 \leq \texttt{mex} \cdot 2$. The lower
bound of our smallest value of $l$ is $r-\texttt{mex} \cdot 2 + 1$, which we can find by rearranging the previous inequality.

After this, we know that all values between $l$ and the lower bound of $l$ are valid left bounds for our given $r$, so we can add $l-\texttt{smallest\_l} + 1$ to the answer. However, we must consider the lower bound of $l$ as $0$ if it's negative, and not add $l-\texttt{smallest\_l} + 1$ if it is negative.

If $\texttt{pos} < l$, we can decrement from $l$ to $\texttt{pos}+1$, calculating all possible values of $r$ in a similar fashion.

We can store the position of each integer, allowing us to find the position of the next $\texttt{mex}$ without having to search through the array.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N)$

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

using ll = long long;

int main() {
	int test_num;
	cin >> test_num;
	for (int t = 0; t < test_num; t++) {
		int n;
		cin >> n;

		// stores position of integer
		vector<int> pos(n);

		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			int x;
			cin >> x;
			pos[x] = i;
		}

		// initialize left and right bounds for mex
		int l = pos[0], r = pos[0];
		ll ans = 1;

		// mex represents the current mex l and r cover
		for (int mex = 1; mex < n; mex++) {
			int next_pos = pos[mex];

			// skip if next_pos is already between l and r
			if (l <= next_pos && next_pos <= r) { continue; }

			// Since we can create a valid subsegment for a given mex up until
			// size mex * 2, our max difference between l and r is mex * 2 - 1.
			int max_diff = mex * 2 - 1;

			if (next_pos < l) {
				for (; l > next_pos; l--) {
					int largest_r = min(l + max_diff, n - 1);
					// add all possible right bounds that don't change the
					// current mex
					ans += max(largest_r - r + 1, 0);
				}
			} else {
				for (; r < next_pos; r++) {
					int smallest_l = max(r - max_diff, 0);
					// add all possible left bounds that don't change the
					// current mex
					ans += max(l - smallest_l + 1, 0);
				}
			}
		}

		cout << ans << '\n';
	}
}
