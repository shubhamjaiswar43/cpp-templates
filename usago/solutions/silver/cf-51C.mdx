What if you were given $d$, and told to compute whether or not it is possible to cover all houses?

</Spoiler>

<Spoiler title = "Hint 2">

Look at just one house. A station has to go somewhere within range of it. Where's the best place to put it?

</Spoiler>

<Spoiler title = "Solution">

## Explanation

Let's binary search on the answer.

Consider the leftmost house. We have to place a station within range of this
house. Because there are no houses to the left, and therefore no reason for the
station's range to extend to the left, an optimal place to put it is as far as
possible to the right, at $\texttt{pos}+d$.

When our first station's range runs out, we can use similar logic to place the
next two â€” there's no need for the range to extend to the left of the leftmost
uncovered house, so we can place the next station as far as possible to the
right again.

Our test function returns true if all the houses can be covered placing the
stations in this manner.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

const long double EPSILON = 1e-7;
int main() {
	int n;
	cin >> n;
	vector<int> x(n);
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { cin >> x[i]; }
	sort(x.begin(), x.end());

	auto test = [&](long double d) -> optional<array<long double, 3>> {
		int used = 0;
		array<long double, 3> pos = {x[0] + d};
		// Checks if each house is within range of the most recently placed
		// station, if not, builds a new one (unless there are none left)
		for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
			if (x[i] - pos[used] > d) {
				used++;
				if (used == 3) { return nullopt; }
				pos[used] = x[i] + d;
			}
		}
		return pos;
	};

	auto midpoint = [&](long double x, long double y) -> long double {
		return (x + y) / 2;
	};

	long double lo = 0, hi = 1e9;
	array<long double, 3> ans;
	while (hi - lo > EPSILON) {
		long double mid = midpoint(lo, hi);
		if (auto res = test(mid); res) {
			hi = mid;
			ans = *res;
		} else {
			lo = mid;
		}
	}

	cout << fixed << lo << "\n";
	printf("%.6Lf %.6Lf %.6Lf\n", ans[0], ans[1], ans[2]);
}
```

```py
EPSILON = 1e-7


def test(d: int, x: list) -> int:
	used = 0
	pos = [x[0] + d] * 3

	"""
	Checks if each house is within range of the most recently placed
	station, if not, builds a new one (unless there are none left)
	"""

	for i in range(1, len(x)):
		if x[i] - pos[used] > d:
			used += 1
			if used == 3:
				return None
			pos[used] = x[i] + d

	return pos


n = int(input())
x = list(map(int, input().split()))
x.sort()

lo, hi = 0, 1e9
ans = [0.0] * 3

while hi - lo > EPSILON:
	mid = (lo + hi) / 2
	res = test(mid, x)

	if res is not None:
		hi = mid
		ans = res
	else:
