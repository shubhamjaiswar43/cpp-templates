[Official Analysis](https://boi.cses.fi/files/boi2012_solutions.zip)

If we can cover the highway using circles of radius $r_1$, then we can also
cover the highway using circles of radius $r_2 > r_1$. This suggests that we
should binary search for the answer.

## Checking a Radius

If a circle covers a part of a highway, it covers a line segment. Using the
Pythagorean theorem ($a^2 + b^2 = c^2$), we can find the coordinates of the
endpoints of each such segment. Let the segment from the $i$-th tower be $s_i$.

Checking whether a radius is good now becomes checking whether the union of
these segments is a single segment that completely covers the highway.

We can solve this in $\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$ time by sorting the segments by
their left endpoints and then merging each segment into the union if it
intersects the union of the previous segments.

Unfortunately, this is just a bit too slow ($\mathcal{O}(N \log N \log L)$ in
total) and only scores 50 points.

Luckily, we don't have to sort the segments!

### A Nice Property

Why would we need to sort the segments in the first place?

Imagine we had three segments $f$, $g$, and $h$ in that order in the unsorted
list. Watch what happens when these segments are arranged as shown below:

![Hack](<baltic-12-mobile/hack.png>)

Without sorting, $g$ wouldn't be part of the union since $f \cap g = \emptyset$.
However, the actual union contains all three segments.

But what if $h$ completely covers $g$?

![Antihack](<baltic-12-mobile/antihack.png>)

In this case, it doesn't matter that $g$ isn't a part of the union, since
$f \cup g \cup h = f \cup h$ anyway.

The nice thing about this particular problem is that if we have segment $s_i$
coming after segment $s_j$ in the list but $s_i$'s left endpoint is to the left
of $s_j$'s left endpoint, then $s_i$ must completely cover $s_j$.

Why is this true? The only time we will have segment $s_i$ coming after segment
$s_j$ in the list but $s_i$'s left endpoint is to the left of $s_j$'s left
endpoint is when $x_i > x_j$ and $y_i < y_j$.

![Circles](<baltic-12-mobile/circles.png>)

Clearly, $s_i$ completely covers $s_j$. We can therefore apply our algorithm for
a sorted list and still get the correct answer!

This gets rid of the $\log N$ factor in our original complexity and so the final
complexity is $\mathcal{O}(N \log L)$, which is good enough for 100 points.

## Implementation

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define x first
#define y second
using namespace std;

pair<long long, long long> p[1000000];

int main() {
	ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
	cin.tie(0);
	int n, len;
	cin >> n >> len;
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) cin >> p[i].x >> p[i].y;

	double l = 1, r = 1.5e9;
	while (r - l > 1e-3) {
		double mid = (l + r) / 2, curr = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			double delta = sqrt(mid * mid - p[i].y * p[i].y);
			double a = p[i].x - delta, b = p[i].x + delta;
			if (a <= curr) curr = max(curr, b);
		}

		if (curr >= len) r = mid;
		else l = mid;
	}

	cout << fixed << setprecision(4) << l;
	return 0;
}
```

<Info title="Faster Solution">

Although not necessary for full credit, there also exists an $\mathcal{O}(N)$ solution.

Try to come up with it yourself before moving on!

</Info>

<Spoiler title="Faster Solution">

The key observation is that not all stations contribute to the answer. If we ever have a station that isn't the closest to any point on the highway, we can simply ignore it.

In fact, we can also ignore some points on the highway! Once we have this list of key stations, the number of points can be bounded by the number of key stations.

<Spoiler title="How?">

Let's say that we're looking for the point on the highway (excluding the endpoints) with the maximum distance to the nearest station, where there are only two stations, $a$ and $b$.

Then, we can imagine a line perpendicular to the line segment formed by these two stations that passes through the midpoint. Everything on the left side is closer to $a$, and everything on the right side is closer to $b$.

Thus, the maximum point is at the point where the perpendicular line intersects the highway! We only have to get the answer from these critical points, and since there are only two stations that could be closest to it, we can compute them in $\mathcal{O}(1)$.

![Maximum Point](<baltic-12-mobile/perpendicular.png>)

This intersection can be represented by $\frac{b_x^2 + b_y^2 - a_x^2 - a_y^2}{2(b_x - a_x)}$.

From here on, we'll refer to this point as $p(a, b)$, where $a$ and $b$ are stations.

</Spoiler>

Now, let's consider cases where there exist unnecessary stations.

Without loss of generality, let's assume all points are above the y-axis, and $a_x < b_x < c_x$. If not all the points are above the y-axis, we can just flip their sign because the distance to the x-axis remains the same.

### Case 1: $p(a, b) < p(b, c)$

In this arrangement, all stations are the closest to some points on the highway, so we should keep them.

![Case 1](<baltic-12-mobile/case1.png>)

### Case 2: $p(a, b) > p(b, c)$

Note how this creates a cross, which makes $b$ useless. All points on the highway are now closer to $a$ or $c$. To find the maximum point here, we can just remove $b$, and recalculate for $p(a, c)$.

![Case 2](<baltic-12-mobile/case2.png>)

Since we only remove the most recent stations, this motivates the use of a [stack](/gold/stacks) to perform these removals/additions in $\mathcal{O}(1)$.
