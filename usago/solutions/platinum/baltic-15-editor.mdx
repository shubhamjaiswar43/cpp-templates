## Explanation

Let `lev[x]=max(0,-a[x])`.

Let `active_y[x]=true` if operation `x` is active after `y` operations, and
`false` otherwise. Obviously `active_y[y]=true`.

Let `activepath_y[x]=true` if operation `x` could possibly be undone after
another operation, and `false` otherwise. In other words, `active_y[x]=true` and
no `z>x` exists with `active_y[z]=true` and `lev[z]<=lev[x]`. If this is the
case, we'll say that "`x` lies on the active path of `y`." Obviously,
`activepath_y[y]=true`.

**Claim:** If `activepath_y[x]` then `active_y[1..x]=active_x[1..x]`.

**Proof:** We use induction. Suppose that this is true for `y=1..q` and we we
want to prove it for `y=q+1`. If `lev[q+1]=0` then `q+1` is the only vertex on
the active path for `q+1`, so this obviously holds. Otherwise, assume that
operation `q+1` undoes operation `z` on the active path for `q`. By the
inductive hypothesis, `active_q[1..z]=active_z[1..z]`, which implies that
`active_{q+1}[1..z-1]=active_{z-1}[1..z-1]`.

All operations on the active path for `q+1` aside from `q+1` itself also lie on
the active path for `z-1`. Also, for any `t` on the active path for `z-1`,
`active_t[1..t]=active_{z-1}[1..t]=active_{q+1}[1..t]`. This completes the
proof.

So the solution is to maintain the active path for every `i`. If there exists an
operation with level 0 on the active path for `i`, then its state is the answer
for `i`; otherwise, the answer for `i` is 0.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal O(N \log N)$.

```cpp
#include <cassert>
#include <iostream>

const int MAX_N = 3e5 + 1;
const int MAX_D = 19;  // ceil(log2(3*(10^5)))

int state[MAX_N], par[MAX_N][MAX_D], lev[MAX_N];

/** get last op on active path of x with lev <= max_lev */
int get_par(int x, int max_lev) {
	if (lev[x] <= max_lev) { return x; }
	for (int i = MAX_D - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
		if (lev[par[x][i]] > max_lev) { x = par[x][i]; }
	}
	return par[x][0];
}

int main() {
	int n;
	std::cin >> n;
	for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
		std::cin >> state[i];
		if (state[i] < 0) {
			lev[i] = -state[i];
			int z = get_par(i - 1, lev[i] - 1);
			assert(z);  // must be something to undo
			par[i][0] = get_par(z - 1, lev[i] - 1);

			// levels of ops in active path are strictly decreasing
			assert(lev[i] > lev[par[i][0]]);

			for (int j = 1; j < MAX_D; j++) {
				par[i][j] = par[par[i][j - 1]][j - 1];  // prepare binary jumps
			}
		}
		std::cout << state[get_par(i, 0)] << '\n';
		// current active path is i, par[i], par[par[i]], ...
	}
}
```
