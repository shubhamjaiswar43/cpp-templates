<Spoiler title = "Hint 1">

Consider the number of cells at every height. If $x$ is the number of cells
at a given height, then this level contributes $\frac{x(x - 1)}{2}$ inefficiency
to the boat. Because of this, the order in which we order the masts does not
matter. What order should we process them in?

</Spoiler>

<Spoiler title = "Hint 2">

If we process the masts in sorted order of height, then for each mast we can
pick the $k$ levels within our allowed height that have the least amount of
sails already on them, and add these sails to these levels. How can we
efficiently perform this operation?

</Spoiler>

<Spoiler title = "Explanation">

As mentioned in the hints, we process each mast in sorted order. We can maintain
a binary indexed tree maintaining the number of sails at each level in descending
order. We place all sails on the range $[h[i] - k[i] + 1, h[i]]$ (in the BIT),
as that is optimal. To handle placing a sail on every index in the range, we
use the difference array idea on our BIT.

However, applying this range addition may cause the values in the BIT to be
sorted in descending order. Let's assume that after applying all the updates,
the values in the BIT are the following:

$$[5, 5, 4, 3, 1]$$

If we directly perform a range addition on the last four elements, the resulting
values will be:

$$[5, 6, 5, 4, 2]$$

To remedy this issue, we split up our range addition into two separate updates.
In the case above, we can just split our previous range addition into updates
on the range $[1, 1]$ and $[3, 5]$.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N\log^2N)$

<Info title = "Faster Solution">
It is possible to cut a log factor by walking on the BIT, as described in
[this](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/61364) blog.
