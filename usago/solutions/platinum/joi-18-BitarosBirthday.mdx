## Explanation

Let's solve the $q = 1$ subtask first. Let's reverse the graph so that in this query, we are solving for the longest path from $t$ to an unblocked node. Here, we can just use DP to compute the longest path to every possible node $s$. If $\texttt{dp}_i$ stores the longest path from $t$ to $i$, then $\texttt{dp}_v = \max(\texttt{dp}_v, \texttt{dp}_u + 1)$, over all $v$ where $u$ and $v$ are connected by an edge and is reachable from $t$ in the reverse graph. Since it is guaranteed $v < u$, this can be done with a single sweep.

Now, let's bring in sqrt decomposition. The variable in question is the number of blocked nodes, denoted as $y$. Let's denote $B = \sqrt{10^5}$ and suppose all queries have $y \geq B$. Since the sum of $y$ over all queries is bounded by $10^5$, there can be no more than $\frac{10^5}{B} = B$ queries. The number of queries is small enough that  we can run an $\mathcal{O}(n)$ DP algorithm each time, leading to a $\mathcal{O}({Bn})$ runtime.

To handle queries with $y < B$, we have to do some preprocessing. For each node, we can store the $B$ longest paths that ends at that node, each originating from a different initial node. This needs to be done with careful pruning of paths with different lengths originating from the same node. This precomputation is approximately $\mathcal{O}(Bm + n \log(Bn))$, since we need to sort the longest paths after we process each node. To answer queries, we can just loop through the $B$ longest paths of $t$, and find the longest one  starting at an unblocked node. This will also take $\mathcal{O}({Bn})$ time.

<Warning title="Choosing B">

We do not want to choose $B$ such that it equals $\sqrt{10^5}$ exactly! It is apparent that the latter case is much more memory and runtime heavy than the former case, so we need to weigh down $B$ to minimize the effects of the second case. In my code, I use $B = 100$.

</Warning>

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(Bm + n \log(Bn) + Bn)$

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int SQ = 100;  // cutoff for sqrt decomp

int main() {
	cin.tie(0)->sync_with_stdio(0);
	int n, m, q;
	cin >> n >> m >> q;
	vector<vector<int>> rg(n);
	for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
		int u, v;
		cin >> u >> v;
		rg[--v].push_back(--u);
	}

	// stores the 100 longest paths ending at i
	vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> path_sizes(n);
	vector<int> from(n, -1);  // longest path starting at that node

	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		path_sizes[i].push_back({0, i});
		vector<int> from_indicies;

		for (int j : rg[i]) {
			for (auto [dist, idx] : path_sizes[j]) {
				if (from[idx] == -1) {
					// if we haven't gotten a path from this index yet
					from_indicies.push_back(idx);
					from[idx] = dist + 1;
				} else {
					// take max with already processed dist
					from[idx] = max(from[idx], dist + 1);
				}
			}
		}

		for (int j : from_indicies) { path_sizes[i].push_back({from[j], j}); }
		sort(path_sizes[i].rbegin(), path_sizes[i].rend());
		// pop until sqrt paths
		while (path_sizes[i].size() > SQ) { path_sizes[i].pop_back(); }

		// reset
		for (int j : from_indicies) { from[j] = -1; }
	}

	vector<bool> blocked(n);
	for (int query = 0; query < q; query++) {
		int t, y;
		cin >> t >> y;
		t--;

		vector<int> c(y);
		for (int i = 0; i < y; i++) {
			cin >> c[i];
			blocked[--c[i]] = true;
		}

		int ans = -1;
		if (y >= SQ) {
			// brute force dp since number of queries is bounded by sqrt
			vector<int> dp(t + 1, -1);  // dp[i] stores longest path ending at i
			dp[t] = 0;
			for (int i = t; i >= 0; i--) {
				if (dp[i] == -1) { continue; }
				if (!blocked[i]) { ans = max(ans, dp[i]); }
				for (int j : rg[i]) { dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[i] + 1); }
			}
		} else {
			for (auto [dist, idx] : path_sizes[t]) {
				if (!blocked[idx]) {
					ans = dist;
					break;
				}
			}
		}

		cout << ans << "\n";

		for (int i : c) { blocked[i] = false; }
	}
