## Explanation

After running the brute force solution, one can observe that the period of how matrix looks like is the smallest power of two such that it's greater than both $n$ and $m$.

Also, we can reduce the problem to finding the xor-sum of the elements in positions such that the number of roads from $(0, 0)$ to $(i, j)$ in $k$ steps is odd, where $k$ is the number of transformations done.

This is equal to $C(k, i) \cdot C(k, j)$, where $C(n, k)$ is $n$ choose $k$. Also, if $C(n, k)$ is odd, then $n \& k = k$ (this can also be observed by brute-force).

Also, if $C(n, i)$ and $C(n, j)$ are odd, then $C(n, i|j)$ is odd as well, so we can reduce the problem to SOS DP, where $SOS[i]$ = xorsum of elements which are in positions included by $i$.

For each bit of the period, $SOS[i] = SOS[i - 2^{position}] \oplus SOS[i]$, if $i$ has the bit on position equal to $1$.

For other approaches, you can also check out the user solutions on [Infoarena](https://infoarena.ro/monitor?task=xortransform), just make sure to press that popup you receive after you first click on a solution. Take note that the version used is slightly different from the actual version, as this problem was given as an interactive problem and Infoarena couldn't support interactive problems at the time.

## Implementation for infoarena version

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N \cdot M \cdot \log N)$

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	ifstream f("xortransform.in");
	int n, m, q;
	f >> n >> m >> q;
	vector<int> sos(n * m * 2 + 1);
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
			int nr;
			f >> nr;
			sos[i | j] ^= nr;
		}
	}

	int mx = 1;
	int stp = 1;
	while (mx < n || mx < m) {
		mx <<= 1;
		stp++;
	}
	for (int i = 0; i < stp; i++) {
		for (int j = 0; j < mx; j++) {
			if (j & (1 << i)) { sos[j] ^= sos[j - (1 << i)]; }
		}
	}

	int prev_ans = 0;
	ofstream g("xortransform.out");
	for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
		int nr;
		f >> nr;
		nr ^= prev_ans;
		nr &= (mx - 1);
		prev_ans = sos[nr];
		g << prev_ans << '\n';
	}
}
```
