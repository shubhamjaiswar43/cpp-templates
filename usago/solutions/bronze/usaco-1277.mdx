<Spoiler title="Hint">

When is it possible to reduce a string to "MOO"?
When is it not?
What's the key differentiating factor between these two cases?

<Spoiler title="Answer to Hint">

It's possible to reduce any string to "MOO" as long as there's a substring
of length 3 with an "O" in the middle.
If there isn't, we can't get "MOO" because there's no way to change the middle character.

[Official Analysis (C++ and Java)](http://usaco.org/current/data/sol_prob3_bronze_jan23.html)

## Explanation

For each string, we go through all substrings of length 3 and try to make those the characters we preserve.

What does that mean?

Well, for any string longer than "MOO," we're going to have to delete some characters.
For example, in the first sample input string "MOMMOM", an optimal solution is to preserve the first 3 and delete the last 3.
For each of these length-3 substrings, we check if there's an "O" in the middle.

If there is, it's possible to make this string "MOO"!
We then check if the starting character and ending character need to be changed, as those are additional operations we have to take into account.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N)$ for each string, where $N$ is the length of the string.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int str_num;
	cin >> str_num;
	for (int s = 0; s < str_num; s++) {
		string str;
		cin >> str;
		// Handle the edge case where the string is shorter than "MOO"
		if (str.size() < 3) {
			cout << -1 << '\n';
			continue;
		}

		// char_diff characters have to be removed regardless of the string
		int char_diff = str.size() - 3;
		int min_ops = INT32_MAX;
		for (int i = 0; i < str.size() - 2; i++) {
			// See if we can preserve this substring and make it "MOO"
			if (str[i + 1] == 'O') {
				// Check if we have to change the front and back
				bool change_front = str[i] != 'M';
				bool change_back = str[i + 2] != 'O';
				// Update the min operations needed
				min_ops = min(min_ops, char_diff + change_front + change_back);
			}
		}

		cout << (min_ops == INT32_MAX ? -1 : min_ops) << '\n';
	}
}
```

```py
for _ in range(int(input())):
	word = input()

	# `char_diff` characters have to be removed regardless of the string
	char_diff = len(word) - 3
	min_ops = float("inf")

	for i in range(len(word) - 2):
		# Check if `word[i : i+3]` can form "MOO"
		if word[i + 1] == "O":
			# Check if we have to change the front and back
			change_front = word[i] != "M"
			change_back = word[i + 2] != "O"

			min_ops = min(min_ops, char_diff + change_front + change_back)

	print(-1 if min_ops == float("inf") else int(min_ops))
