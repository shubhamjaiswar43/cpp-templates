## Explanation

Let's start from a more simple case, when the grid will only contain letters `a` and `b`. Let's associate for each letter a value corresponding to its position in the alphabet (for now, `a` equals $0$ and `b` equals $1$). Now we will have to find the number of submatrices such that we have ones in the top left and bottom right corners we have $1$ and we have $0$ everywhere else.

Let's construct another grid of size $n \times n$ where $b(i, j)$ stores the number of consecutive $0$ on the column $j$ above the position $(i, j)$.

Now for each line from $2$ to $n$, for a given position $(i, j)$ which is equal to $1$ (we will consider this the bottom-right corner), we will move from right to left on that line to find the values equal to $1$ placed at coordinates $(i, k)$ where $k < j$ such that $b(i, k) > 0$ and $b(i, k)$ strictly smaller than all values $b(i, p)$ with $p$ between $k+1$ and $j$.

The complexity of this approach is $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$.

Now we need to generalize for the entire grid, which has all lowercase letters of the alphabet. At each step, we fix a letter, let's call it $ch$.

For that letter, we will now create a grid where the positions corresponding to all the letters which are smaller than $ch$ will be equal to $0$, all letters equal to $ch$ will be equal to $1$ and all letters greater than $ch$ will be equal to $2$.

Just like we did it for the binary grid, we will count how many submatrices have values equal to $0$ except for the two corners aforementioned. In order to avoid overcounting, we will only count the submatrices such that they contain $1$ in at least a corner. Now, when we process a position $(i, j)$ we will do as such: if on that position we have $1$, we will count the number of previous position which correspond to both $1$ and $2$, and if on the same position we have $2$, we will only count the previous positions that are equal to $1$.

The complexity of this approach is still $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ for each letter, which gives us an overall complexity of $\mathcal{O}(sigma \times n^2)$, where $sigma = 26$ is the length of the alphabet.
