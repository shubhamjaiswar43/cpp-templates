<Spoiler title="Hint 1">

Instead of trying to traverse from our starting node to an endpoint, consider
starting from our endpoints and try to reach our starting node.

<Spoiler title="Hint 2">

The crocodile will try to prevent us from taking the best path from
a given endpoint to any other node. How can we use this knowledge to decide the
shortest time it would take to reach a node from any endpoint?

<Spoiler title="Solution">

## Explanation

Say we want to reach a given node from an endpoint in our graph. The crocodile
will always block the best route to an endpoint in our graph, which means we
have to take the second best route to an endpoint.

Handling decision making for what the "best choice" at a given vertex is
difficult if we are to implement a shortest paths algorithm directly to our
graph. Thus, we instead choose to model our problem in a slightly different way:
instead of considering the best distance from our starting node to every endpoint,
we consider the best distance from any endpoint to our starting node.

This makes handling decision making significantly easier because it means that
we can only use the second best distance to any given node. Our algorithm then
becomes your typical multi-source Dijkstra, except we push to the priority queue
every time the second best distance becomes better.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(M\log{M})$

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int travel_plan(int n, int m, int r[][2], int l[], int k, int p[]) {
	vector<vector<array<int, 2>>> adj(n);
	for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
		adj[r[i][0]].push_back({r[i][1], l[i]});
		adj[r[i][1]].push_back({r[i][0], l[i]});
	}

	// 1e9 because the answer is guaranteed to be less than that
	const array<int, 2> DEFAULT = {(int)1e9, (int)1e9};
	// dist[i] = {best distance, second best distance}
	vector<array<int, 2>> dist(n, DEFAULT);
	priority_queue<array<int, 2>> pq;
	for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
		pq.push({0, p[i]});
		dist[p[i]] = {0, 0};
	}

	while (!pq.empty()) {
		auto [time, at] = pq.top();
		pq.pop();
		time *= -1;  // undoing the negative number trick
		if (dist[at][1] < time) { continue; }
		for (const auto [nxt, weight] : adj[at]) {
			if (time + weight < dist[nxt][0]) {
				if (dist[nxt][0] < dist[nxt][1]) { pq.push({-dist[nxt][0], nxt}); }
				dist[nxt][1] = dist[nxt][0];
				dist[nxt][0] = time + weight;
			} else if (time + weight < dist[nxt][1]) {
				dist[nxt][1] = time + weight;
				pq.push({-dist[nxt][1], nxt});
			}
		}
	}

	return dist[0][1];
}
```
