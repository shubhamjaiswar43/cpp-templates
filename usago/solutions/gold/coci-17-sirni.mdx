<Spoiler title="Hint 1">

With $10^5$ cards, there's way too many possible edges brute force would have to consider.
Is there any way we can cut out a majority of these possible edges?

</Spoiler>

<Spoiler title="Hint 2">

Say you have a card with value $5$, and you have two other cards with values $12$ and $13$.
Is it *ever* optimal to link $5$ to $13$?

</Spoiler>

<Spoiler title="Solution">

## Explanation

Following the first hint, let's try to build up a candidate list of edges that have some semblance of a chance at being included in Daniel's MST.

First, let's sort the cards.
We can also just not consider any duplicate cards, as those can be linked to other cards of the same value at zero cost.

Now for each card $c$, we want to find all possible cards that might link up with it in an MST.
Since edges go both ways, we only have to consider cards with values greater than $c$.

Here's where the second hint comes in.
No matter what other cards are in this example, it will always be optimal for $5$ to link up with $12$ instead of $13$.

To generalize this, say we have a card with value $n$, and we have some values in between $kn$ and $(k+1) \cdot n$, where $k$ is some random multiple.
Among these values, it will always make sense for us to choose the one closest to $kn$, as that will give the least cost.

<Info title="Too slow?">

You might think that looping through all multiples is too slow, but since all numbers are distinct, the total number of iterations is somewhere around $\frac{P}{1}+\frac{P}{2}+\frac{P}{3}+\cdots+\frac{P}{P}$.
This is the [harmonic series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_series_(mathematics)), which is actually bounded by $\mathcal{O}(P \log{P})$!

</Info>

For us to apply this observation, we do have to do some precalculations to find the next greater value for each possible card value, but this is doable in linear time.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N \log{N} + P \log{P})$
