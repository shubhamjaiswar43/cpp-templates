## Explanation

To solve this problem, we write a tree DP. Consider that the only factor we
need to differentiate nodes on is whether or not we can connect a given node
to its parent. Thus, our DP state is the following:

- $\texttt{dp}[u][0]$ is the best result in the subtree of $u$ if we can connect $u$ to its parent
- $\texttt{dp}[u][1]$ is the best result in the subtree of $u$ if we can't connect $u$ to its parent

For a given node $u$, the "gain" we get from adding this node in is:

$$
(w + \texttt{dp}[u][0]) - \texttt{dp}[u][1]
$$

Thus, we want to use our $d[u]$ allowed edges on the nodes that have the most
benefit when adding an edge to them. Note that we handle the cases for
$\texttt{dp}[u][0])$ and $\texttt{dp}[u][1]$ pretty similarly.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N\log{N})$

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

using ll = long long;

int main() {
	int n;
	cin >> n;

	vector<int> d(n);
	for (int &i : d) { cin >> i; }

	vector<vector<array<int, 2>>> adj(n);
	for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
		int u, v, w;
		cin >> u >> v >> w;
		u--, v--;
		adj[u].push_back({v, w});
		adj[v].push_back({u, w});
	}

	// DP state is for the relation with its parent node
	// {can connect, can't connect}
	vector<array<ll, 2>> dp(n);
	const auto dfs = [&](int u, int p, auto self) -> void {
		auto &[can_con, no_con] = dp[u];
		vector<ll> diffs;  // diff between using edge and not using edge

		for (const auto &[v, w] : adj[u]) {
			if (v == p) { continue; }
			self(v, u, self);
			can_con += dp[v][1];
			no_con += dp[v][1];
			if (d[v] > 0) { diffs.push_back(w + dp[v][0] - dp[v][1]); }
		}

		int leftover = d[u];

		sort(begin(diffs), end(diffs), greater());
		for (const ll &val : diffs) {
			if (leftover == 0 || val < 0) { break; }
			if (leftover > 1) {
				can_con += val;
				no_con += val;
			} else {
				no_con += val;
			}
			leftover--;
		}
	};
	dfs(0, -1, dfs);

	cout << dp[0][1] << endl;
}
```
