[Official Analysis (C++)](http://www.usaco.org/current/data/sol_cowpatibility_gold_dec18.html)

<Spoiler title="Hint">

Instead of trying to find the number of incompatible pairs, try to find the number of *compatible* pairs instead!

This is known as [complementary counting](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Complementary_counting).

<Spoiler title="Solution">

## Explanation

Since there are a total of $\frac{N(N-1)}{2}$ pairs of cows, if we can count the number of compatible pairs, we can subtract it from the total to get our answer!

We can use [PIE (Principle of Inclusion/Exclusion)](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Principle_of_Inclusion-Exclusion) to calculate the number of compatible pairs! We'll have to add all pairs of cows that share one flavor in common, subtract cows that share two flavors in common,
and so on...

To understand why this works, imagine we only have three flavors of icecreams and that some cows share more than one flavor. If we were to only
count the pairs of cows with one flavor, the pairs of cows that share two flavors would be overcounted, as shown in the animation below:

To avoid considering rearranged sets of the same flavors, we'll sort the favorite flavors of each cow beforehand.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N)$

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

const int FLAVORS = 5;

int main() {
	freopen("cowpatibility.in", "r", stdin);
	freopen("cowpatibility.out", "w", stdout);

	long long n;
	cin >> n;

	vector<array<int, FLAVORS>> cows(n);

	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		for (int j = 0; j < FLAVORS; j++) { cin >> cows[i][j]; }

		// sort flavors to avoid double counting
		sort(cows[i].begin(), cows[i].end());
	}

	// common[i][j] = the number of cows that share i flavors (j) in common
	vector<map<array<int, FLAVORS>, int>> common(FLAVORS);

	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		common[4][cows[i]]++;

		// iterate over all subsets
		for (int a = 0; a < FLAVORS; a++) {
			common[0][{cows[i][a]}]++;
			for (int b = a + 1; b < FLAVORS; b++) {
				common[1][{cows[i][a], cows[i][b]}]++;
				for (int c = b + 1; c < FLAVORS; c++) {
					common[2][{cows[i][a], cows[i][b], cows[i][c]}]++;
					for (int d = c + 1; d < FLAVORS; d++) {
						common[3][{cows[i][a], cows[i][b], cows[i][c], cows[i][d]}]++;
					}
				}
			}
		}
	}

	long long compatible = 0;
	// use PIE to count the number of compatible pairs
	// (see explanation above)
	for (int i = 0; i < FLAVORS; i++) {
		for (auto &[k, v] : common[i]) {
			if (i % 2 == 0) {
				compatible += (long long)v * (v - 1) / 2;
			} else {
				compatible -= (long long)v * (v - 1) / 2;
			}
		}
	}

	cout << (n * (n - 1) / 2) - compatible << endl;
}
```

```py
from itertools import combinations
from collections import defaultdict

FLAVORS = 5

with open("cowpatibility.in", "r") as read:
	n = int(read.readline().strip())
	cows = []

	for _ in range(n):
		flavors = list(map(int, read.readline().strip().split()))
		flavors.sort()  # Sort to avoid double counting
		cows.append(flavors)

# common[i][j] = the number of cows that share i flavors (j) in common
common = [defaultdict(int) for _ in range(FLAVORS)]

for flavors in cows:
	common[4][tuple(flavors)] += 1

	# iterate over all subsets
	for size in range(1, FLAVORS):
		for subset in combinations(flavors, size):
			common[size - 1][subset] += 1

compatible = 0
# use PIE to count the number of compatible pairs
# (see explanation above)
for i in range(FLAVORS):
	for subset, count in common[i].items():
		if i % 2 == 0:
			compatible += count * (count - 1) // 2
		else:
			compatible -= count * (count - 1) // 2

res = n * (n - 1) // 2 - compatible
print(res, file=open("cowpatibility.out", "w"))
```
