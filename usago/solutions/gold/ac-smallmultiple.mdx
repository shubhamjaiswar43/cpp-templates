## Explanation

All positive integers can be created by starting from 1 and repeating the
following two operations:

1. Multiply the current number by 10. At this time, the sum of each digit does not change.
2. Add 1 to the current number. At this time, the sum of each digit increases
   by 1. (This does not apply when the ones place is 9, but we will show later
   that you do not need to take this into account when solving this problem.)

Now, let's consider a graph with all positive integers as vertices and an edge
from the "current number" to the "new number" of the above operation. What we
need to find is the shortest path length on this graph from 1 to any multiple of
K plus 1.

As it is, the number of vertices is infinite, but if you consider how the edges
are drawn, you can see that the vertices corresponding to each positive integer
can be equated with mod K.

Therefore, we only need to find the shortest path from 1 to 0 on a graph of K
vertices, where each vertex is equated with mod K, and this can be found in O(K)
time using [0-1 BFS](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/22276).

A transition that adds 1 to an integer with a 1's digit of 9 does not need to be
treated specially because if you recall the shortest path algorithm, you can see
that the destination vertex has already been visited.
For example, if we go from 9 to 10 using the second case we don't need to worry about vertex 10 since it will already be visited from the first case.

Note that 0-1 BFS is a breadth-first search algorithm that prepares a deque
(double-ended queue) and adds elements to the beginning of the deque for edge
transitions with a cost of 0, and to the end of the deque for edge transitions
of 1.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(K)$

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int INF = 1e9;

int main() {
	int k;
	scanf("%d", &k);

	// dist[i] = smallest digit sum to reach i % k
	vector<int> dist(k, INF);

	deque<int> q;

	dist[1] = 1;
	q.push_front(1);

	while (!q.empty()) {
		int cur = q.front();
		q.pop_front();

		// case 1: we append an extra 0 at the end (NO EXTRA COST)
		int case1 = cur * 10 % k;
		if (dist[cur] < dist[case1]) {
			dist[case1] = dist[cur];
			q.push_front(case1);
		}

		// case 2: we add one to cur but also increase the digit sum
		int case2 = (cur + 1) % k;
		if (dist[cur] + 1 < dist[case2]) {
			dist[case2] = dist[cur] + 1;
			q.push_back(case2);
		}
	}

	// the answer must be 0 mod k
	printf("%d\n", dist[0]);
}
```

from collections import deque

k = int(input())

# dist[i] = smallest digit sum to reach i % k
dist = [float("inf")] * k
q = deque()

dist[1] = 1
q.appendleft(1)

while q:
	cur = q.popleft()

	# case 1: append an extra 0 at the end (NO EXTRA COST)
	case1 = cur * 10 % k
	if dist[cur] < dist[case1]:
		dist[case1] = dist[cur]
		q.appendleft(case1)

	# case 2: add one to cur but increase the digit sum
	case2 = (cur + 1) % k
	if dist[cur] + 1 < dist[case2]:
		dist[case2] = dist[cur] + 1
		q.append(case2)

# the answer must be 0 mod k
print(dist[0])
