<Spoiler title="Hint 1">

A neat trick we can use to handle rotations is to augment our array.

Say we have an array of length $n$ and want to consider all cyclic rotations
of the array. Then, we can construct an array of size $2n$, where each element
$i$ is mapped to $i$ and $i+n$. From there, we just need to consider every
length $n$ subarray of this augmented array.

We can use this same idea on our 2D grid. Thus, the problem reduces to finding
the lexicographically smallest $n$ row by $m$ column subgrid in our augmented
grid.

<Spoiler title="Hint 2">

Consider the process of lexicographically comparing two strings. We first loop
through a bunch of identical characters, then run into an index where the two
strings differ.

To compare subgrids fast, we want to cut through all the identical characters
as fast as possible. Recall the string problem of finding the least
common prefix between two strings: one solution is to use binary search and
hashing. How can we extend this solution to a grid?

<Spoiler title="Solution">

To find the best rectangle, we brute force every relevant subgrid of our augmented
grid, and find the best one.

Comparing two rectangles lexicographically is a bit tricky. Recall the
least common prefix problem: we binary search on the last index where the two
strings have equivalent hashes.

We separate the problem of finding the first differing index into two parts:
1. Finding the first row where there are differing values
2. Within this first row, finding the first index where the positions differ

Step 2 is easily done with binary search and hashing. But how do we accomplish
our goal in step 1?

For a given cell $(i, j)$, we only care about one subarray in row $i$, that
being $[j, j + m)$. Thus, what we can do is hash our hashes: we keep
a hash table for each column that keeps track of the row hashes.

Similar to step 2, we use binary search to complete step 1 of the comparison process.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(NM \log(NM))$
